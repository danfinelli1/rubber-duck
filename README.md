Not knowing what type of website we wanted to web app we wanted to build for this project, we went to the throwing board and threw as much as we could at it. Eventually what was apparent was that we wanted to create something that would be of some use to somebody and not just another throwaway website. Daniel Finelli came up with a half-serious/half-joking suggestion of using a rubber duck and Martin Uriarte took off with it.

"Rubber duck debugging. In software engineering, rubber duck debugging or rubber ducking is a method of debugging code. Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a programming problem to someone else [...] and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem. By using an inanimate object, the programmer can try to accomplish this without having to interrupt anyone else." This is, in a nutshell, what Wikipedia has on rubber ducking. With the assistance of General Assembly Instructors Justin Castilla and Jean Weatherwax, we were able to think of making a virtual rubber duck that would serve as a buffer between students and instructors so that the time spent between the two could be used on problems that are at a higher level... RBR Duck.

RBR Duck and it's current version (1.0) allows you to select a technology that you are using in your current project and runs you through the most commonly found issues associated with that particular tech.
